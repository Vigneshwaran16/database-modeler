# Database Modeler

RDBMS modeler using Web Components with vanilla JS
*Only Postgres supported at the moment*

## Why is this different?
- Completely free (This also includes some of the premium features from various cloud-based database modelers)
- Client-side App
- **Framework independent**.

## Roadmap and Proposals
[] Native State management
[] Exporting the model as PNG, .sql
[] Exporting as JSON 
[] Render the model from exported JSON
[] Query Editor support??
[] Syntax checker??
[] Rendering from a database dump 

## Contribution Guidelines

*Will be updated in the near future*

## Philosophy

- **WYSIWYG**. No unwanted bundled/bloated code to load the app on client-side. Developers can see the actual code as how it was developed.
