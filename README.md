# Database Modeler

RDBMS modeler using Web Components with vanilla JS
*Only Postgres supported at the moment*

## Why is this different?
- Completely free (This also includes some of the premium features from various cloud-based database modelers)
- Client-side App
- **Framework independent**.

## Roadmap and Proposals
- [ ] Native State management
- [ ] Exporting the model as PNG, .sql
- [ ] Exporting as JSON 
- [ ] Render the model from exported JSON
- [ ] Query Editor support??
- [ ] Syntax checker??
- [ ] Rendering from a database dump 

## Contribution Guidelines

*Will be updated in the near future*
